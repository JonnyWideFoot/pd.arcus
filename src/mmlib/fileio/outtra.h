	/// \brief  Base Class for saving the state of the WorkSpace, System or a Molecule. 
	/// \details This class is used to create files from a WorkSpace, System or Molecule.
	///          Note that this only creates single files, not trajectories. For Trajectories use
	///          the class hierarchy deriving from OutputTrajectory.
	///          OutputFile can be called in two different ways. Either a system/workspace is passed as an argument
	///          or the "save" function of a system/workspace is used. Both lead to the same result:
	///          The constructor requires a filename or a filestem (the extension is added automatically if its missing). 
	///
	///          Intended use of the derived class (here for a format XXX) is demonstrated below: 
	/*! 
	\code

	OutputFile_XXX  mypdb("test.pdb");
