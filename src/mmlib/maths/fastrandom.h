/// \brief Provides Random Numbers

/// \details 
/// Adapted from an article on www.codeproject.com

/// 'I'm happy for the code to be reused in whatever context so if you want I can send a modified version 
/// of the source with extra license blurb and get them to update the zip file on here.'
///
/// Key points:
/// 1) Based on a simple and fast xor-shift pseudo random number generator (RNG) specified in:
/// Marsaglia, George. (2003). Xorshift RNGs.
/// http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/xorshift.pdf
///
/// This particular implementation of xorshift has a period of 2^128-1. See the above paper to see
/// how this can be easily extened if you need a longer period.
///
/// 2) Allows fast re-initialisation with a seed, unlike System.Random which accepts a seed at construction
/// time which then executes a relatively expensive initialisation routine. This provides a vast speed improvement
/// if you need to reset the pseudo-random number sequence many times, e.g. if you want to re-generate the same
/// sequence many times. An alternative might be to cache random numbers in an array, but that approach is limited
/// by memory capacity and the fact that you may also want a large number of different sequences cached. Each sequence
/// can each be represented by a single seed value (int) when using FastRandom.
///
/// \note 
/// A further performance improvement can be obtained by declaring local variables as static, thus avoiding
/// re-allocation of variables on each call. However care should be taken if multiple instances of
/// FastRandom are in use or if being used in a multi-threaded environment.
