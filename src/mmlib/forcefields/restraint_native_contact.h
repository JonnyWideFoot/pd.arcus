	/// \brief Calculates Native contacts and can apply a constraint to it for umbrella
	/// Type applications etc.
	///
	/// \details 
  ///
  ///    Using this forcefield a peptide or protein can be maintained in its particular backbone 
  ///    conformation using a restraint on the number of native contacts. A form similar to 
	///    Brooks et al. (F. B. Sheinerman and C. L. Brooks III. Calculations on folding of segment b1 of streptococcal protein G. J. Mol. Biol., 278:439456, 1998. ) 
  ///    is used, although the order parameter used here is inverted with respect to theirs (their native state 
  ///    is at $\rho=0.0$ where as in the form used here it is at $\rho=1.0$). The fraction of native 
  ///    contacts in a given conformation is given by
  ///    
  ///    \begin{equation}
  ///      \rho = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N \frac{1}{1 + exp\left[ \vartheta \left( r_{ij} - r_{0} \right) \right]}
  ///    \end{equation}
  ///    
  ///    where the sum runs over all $N$ native contacts, $r_{ij}$ is the inter-atomic distance between the 
  ///    two atoms involved in a given contact while $r_0$ is the distance at which a contact is no longer 
  ///    considered to be formed. $r_0$ was set to 9\AAs. $\vartheta$ is the steepness of the sigmoidal 
  ///    switch function which determines if a given contact is currently formed or not and was set to 
  ///    1.5 giving a comparably smooth transition which 
  ///    appears to work better in a continuous simulation such as Molecular Dynamics.
  ///    Contacts were considered only between C$_\alpha$ atoms and were considered native when their distance 
  ///    was less than $r_{0} - \ln(1.0/0.1 - 1)/\vartheta$ in the starting structure. The extra term  involving 
  ///    the logarithm  ensures that the sigmoidal function is at least 0.9 at the native distance. If this extra 
  ///    term is left out, $\rho$ is significantly smaller than 1.0 at the native structure and applying a restraint 
  ///    to $\rho$ actually distorts the native state since it pushes the longer contacts further together. 
  ///    Note that ``native'' here refers to ``native with respect to a given conformation'', not with 
  ///    respect to the NMR/XRAY structure.
