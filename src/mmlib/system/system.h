/// \brief A System is a container for Molecules and provides functions for manipulating them. 
///
/// \details 
/// A simulation system is set up in a System which is mainly a container that holds objects of the 
/// type Molecule, which in turn possess lists of atom coordinates and properties. The system is thus 
/// stored in a hierarchical manner allowing easy modification and duplication of molecules and other 
/// components. The Molecules are created as separate objects and the topology information (such as 
/// covaleing information and other geometrical parameters) are supplied by the FFParamSet 
/// class. The created molecules are then inserted into the system to create the simulation set up. For 
/// example a protein and a ligand can be loaded, brought into correct relative orientation and finally 
/// solvated with a box of water, as well as a few counter ions. For purpose of simulation this system 
/// is then exported into a WorkSpace in which the atoms are stored in a linear array for faster and 
/// simpler access by the Forcefields and Protocols.
