/// \brief Central simulation class 
///
/// \details 
/// Workspace  is responsible for holding a simulation state. It
/// provides a linear atom array where each atom has properties such as
/// position, previous position, force, old force, velocity etc.. which the
/// Protocol s and Forcefield s can modify.
/// Workspace  thus acts as a scratch space for simulations.
/// Workspace  also
/// provides functions to calculate neighbour lists which the
/// Forcefield s can use to calculate non-bonded forces. Further a
/// large variety of structure modifying functions are available such as
/// atom movements, bond rotations, etc..
/// and other transformations as well as basic measuring functions (e.g. to
/// calculate inter-atomic distances or torsion angles). Finally,
/// Workspace contains a Trajectory container class
/// which allows various output trajectory formats (represented by
/// respective classes) to be 'loaded' and thus capture structural snapshots
/// of the simulation.
/// A Workspace is always created from a System where the
/// extracted atoms remain linked to the original atoms in the
/// System. Thus, following a simulation,
/// the original positions of the atoms in the System  can be
/// updated and other, different Workspaces created. For example a
/// simulation set up is conceivable in which firstly only the loops in a
/// protein are simulated separately (each with only its immediately
/// surrounding atoms), after which the entire protein is to be minimised or
/// relaxed. This is easily implementable in our setup because of the
/// two-way interaction between System and Workspace.
