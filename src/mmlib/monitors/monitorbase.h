	/// \brief Abstract base class for all monitors. Implements a number of generic
	/// \brief Functions that allow dealing with data output & averaging
	/// \author M.Tyka
	///
	/// A Monitor is a class that performs some sort of measurement on a WorkSpace,
	/// Forcefield or any other property of a simulation system. Usually measurements
	/// need to taken at regular intervals through a simulation in order to obtain
	/// ensemble averages although Monitors can also be used for single measurements.
	/// The Interface is layed out in the abstract class MonitorBase and defines an
	/// abstract function setcurdata() which derived classes must overload, implementing
	/// their particular measurements. Monitors can be added to a simulation protocol
	/// by calling Protocol::addMonitor() which will add a pointer to the respective
	/// Monitor into an internal MonitorContainer class, ”registering” it for execution
	/// during the protocol. When run, the protocol will call the measure() function of
	/// every stored monitor measure() takes the data calculated by the overloaded
	/// function setcurdata() and stores it away in a data array. Following the
	/// simulation, MonitorBase provides a large variety of function that allow
	/// startistical analysis of the stored data such as calculation of averages,
	/// generation of histograms and bootstrap block average analyses. This object
	/// oriented design makes implementation of new monitors trivial, since only a
	/// single function has to be overloaded while the full breadth of functionality
	/// is inherited from MonitorBase.
	///
	/// Monitors implement all kinds of Passive measurements done during a or multiple
	/// simulations. The abstract base class MonitorBase implements a large number of useful functions
	/// for collection, storing and analysing the measured data.
	/// Implemented Classes derived from MonitorBase must implement a function named
	/// setcurdata() - this function is called automatically by the base class function
	/// measure() every time a measurement is to occur. measure() is usually called by a Class
	/// derived from ProtocolBase. For example a class PD_API implementing a Molecular Dynamics
	/// Protocol could call measure() after every time Step.
	/// measure() will then call setcurdata() which must perform the measurement and
	/// call addData(double data) to add it to the stack or store of data.
	/// into a std::vector array for storage.
	///
	/// At the end of the run MonitorBase provides a number of helper functions to
	/// make statistical analyses of the data, create histograms, print & write the data.
	/// External functions provide ways to combine data from multiple monitors to create 2D
	/// histograms or WHAM analyses.
