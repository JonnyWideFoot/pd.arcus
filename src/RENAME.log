Collection of proposed renamings in PD/pd which should be implemented in one big batch
such as to cause minimal disruption to existing scripts. They ought to be well thought 
through to avoid future renaming sessions.
Generally, since class names are now exposed to the python interface namings 
used on the 'outside' should be short, concise and intuitive. THis applies to class names and
class members in the case of paramerers.
