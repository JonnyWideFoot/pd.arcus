EXAMPLES 

Here is a large collection of example scripts to demonstrate most features of PD.
These scripts act in three ways:
a) example usages and demonstration 
b) templates for new simulations
c) unit tests of functionality

Layout:
There should be one script per directory and it *MUST* be called run.py. The scripts
can assume that they are run with the current directory set to the same directory
where the respective run.py file is located.
The reason for this is twofold: The automatic unittesting and the doxygen documentation
scripts both assume that the scripts are called run.py and use that assumption to find
the scripts and/or execute them. In this way one does not need to register a new example
anywhere after adding it - it will be found automatically.

Note: 
These examples assume you have set your PD_PARAM_PATH to the PD library directory.
In bash you can easily do this by saying for example
export PD_PARAM_PATH="/home/myusername/mypddir/lib"

See INSTALL for more details on how to do this
