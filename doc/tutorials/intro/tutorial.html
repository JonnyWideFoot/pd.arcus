<h1>Tutorial 1 - Wetting your appetite: Langevin simulation in implicit solvent</h3>


In this tutorial we will use PD to setup a simple simulation of a small
protein called Trp-Cage using the AMBER ff03 forcefield and
Generalized-Born implicit solvent. We will minimise the PDB structure and
perform a short stochastic dynamics (langevin) simulation. We will develop
the input script step by step introducing various basic PD features
in the process. We will not assume that the reader knows anything about
the Python language. <br>
The following example is designed to demonstrate various features

<h2><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1 Creating an inputscript</h3>

<p>
In the following sections we will create a file <tt> langevin.py </tt>
which will act as our input script. This file is a simple text file and can be edited
and created with any text editor of your choice.


<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.1 Loading PD</h3>

<p>
The first line of the script will import the PD suite into the python
environment making all of it's functionality available to the script.
<p>
<div class="python">
<pre>
from pd import *
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This line will be found at the beginning of every input script.
</p>

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.2 Some preliminaries</h3>

<p>
Before we set up our system, we will a) set the random number seed
of the internal PD random number generator to the current system time
and b) start a generic timer which will later use to obtain the total runtime.

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
ctimeseed()   # set random number seed to current system time
timer()       # start a timer
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These are two example of simple function calls to PD functions and always
have the syntax <tt> functionname(parameter1,parameter2,..,parameterN) </tt><br>
In the above cases there were no parameters required.
Comments can be inserted using the hash character. The python interpreter will ignore anything proceeding a hash.
</p>

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.3 Loading the force field definitions</h3>

<p>
Before we begin a simulation we must load a force field parameter set
from a forcefield file. Here we will use <tt>amber03aa.ff</tt> which defines
the AMBER ff03 forcefield (Duan et al. 2003). It contains information
about protein residues, their atoms, relative positions as well as
physical parameters such as mass, charge etc.. nessessary for simulation.

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
ffps = FFParamSet("amber03aa.ff")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The above is an example of an object creation: We create an object <tt>ffps</tt> using the PD type <tt>FFParamSet</tt> which takes a filename at creation
time. After this instruction we will be able to refer to the data set loaded
from <tt>amber03aa.ff</tt> using the (arbitrary, user-chosen) name <tt>ffps</tt>

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.4 Creating a system</h3>

<p>
Its time to create a simulation system and put some molecules into it.
</p>

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## Create a simulation system using the
## parameter set ffps
sim = System(ffps)
mol = NewProteinPDB(ffps,"trpcage.pdb")
sim.add(mol)
sim.info()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We start by creating another object of type <tt>System</tt>. This acts as a container
for molecules and takes a forcefield parameter set as a parameter at creation time.
We then create a molecule and add it to our simulation box.
<tt>NewProteinPDB</tt> is another standalone
PD function which creates a protein molecule from a PDB file and returns a
new object of type <tt>Molecule</tt> which we call <tt>mol</tt>.
we then add <tt>mol</tt> into the simulation system using the <tt>add</tt> function.
The <tt>add</tt> function is an example of a so called <tt>member function</tt> which unlike the standolne functions we saw earlier is part of a certain type of object. In this example any
object of type <tt>System</tt> (such as <tt>sim</tt> ) has a built-in function called <tt>add</tt>
which accepts molecules as parameters and adds them to the object in question. We will see more examples
of member functions shortly.<br>
Finally we instruct <tt>sim</tt> to print some information about it self. This will display what molecules
are loaded into it.

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.5 Creating a workspace</h3>

<p> Before we run a simulation we must create a <tt>Workspace</tt> from our system. <tt>Workspace</tt> and <tt>System</tt>
are very similar and share many functionalities but have different purposes and a differetn internal
representation.<br>
<tt>System</tt> stores it's atoms in a hierarchical fashion allowing easy manipulation
of the contents. Thus it's primary purpose is the arrangement and setup of a simulation. <br>
<tt>Workspace</tt> stores it's atoms in a linear fashion ideally suited for fast simulation.
Thus it's purpose is to act as a 'scratch space' to do simulations.
We create a <tt>Workspace</tt> by a simple call and subsequently display some information about it.

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## Create a simulation workspace
wspace = WorkSpace( sim )
wspace.info()
</pre>
</div>

<p> Note that in this example our <tt>Workspace</tt>  encompasses the entire <tt>System</tt>.
While this is the case in many situations it is not obligatory. There are mechanisms to transfer
subsets of atoms into a workspace, such as a spherical shell of atoms around a binding site for excample.

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.5 Adding a trajectory</h3>

<p> We want to record atom positions along the trajectory for later analysis. Thus we create a
Trajectory object <tt>Traj_Out</tt> ands add it to our workspace. The format of this particular
trajectory is our inhouse format .tra and the output file will be called <tt>output.tra</tt>

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## Create an output trajectory (tra format)
tra = Traj_Out("output",wspace)
wspace.addTra(tra)

</pre>
</div>

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.6 Creating a forcefield</h3>

<p>Now we will set up a forcefield and add our chosen components into it.

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## create a GB/SA Forcefield using the AMBER
## 03 Parameter set

ff = Forcefield(wspace)

bonds = BondedForcefield()

gb    = GB_Still()
gb.Cutoff = 12.0         ## Cutoffs in Angstrom
gb.InnerCutoff =  9.0
gb.VdwCutoff =  8.0
gb.VdwInnerCutoff =  6.0
gb.FastMode = True

sasa  = SASA_LCPO()
sasa.GlobalASP = 0.005   ## surface tension +5cal/mol

## Add forcefield components to forcefield
ff.add( bonds )
ff.add( gb )
ff.add( sasa )
</pre>
</div>

<p> The first line creates an empty object <tt>ff</tt> of type <tt>Forcefield</tt>
which will act as a container for forcefield components. We then create a <tt>BondedForcefield</tt>
which implements simple bond, angle and torsion terms found in most modern forcefields.<br>
Further we create a <tt>GB_Still</tt> force field component  which implements a particular version
of the widely used Generalized-Born electrostatic model (namely that due to Still et al. 1994).
It also calculates Van der Waals forces. Various properties such as cutoffs and other parameters
are set.<br>
Finally we add a SurfaceArea based force field component <tt>SASA_LCPO</tt> to complete the GB/SA model.
In gbsa all atom types share one common surface tension parameter which is set by setting the propery
<tt>GlobalASP</tt>. The algorithm used to calculate the surface area is the LCPO algorithm a approximate
but fast analytical algorithm.

<p>Finally we add each component to the <tt>Forcefield</tt> to complete the forcefield setup.
Although not the simplest of examples, the above code showcases how easy and flexible it is to
create and mix&match components to create new forcefields.


<p><div class="python">
<pre>
ff.printEnergySummary()  ## calculate energies and show them summarised
ff.info()         ## show parameters
</pre>
</div>


<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.7 Running a simple minimisation</h3>

<p> We are now ready to run our first simulation! Because we loaded an NMR structure from a PDB
file, there may be slight steric clashes so we will run a short minimisation to relax the structure.

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## Run some Minimisation
min = Minimisation(ff)
min.Steps = 50
min.UpdateScr  =  10
min.UpdateNList = 10

min.run()
</pre>
</div>
<p>
As before we create an object <tt>min</tt> of type  <tt>Minimisation</tt> that represents the
minimisation algorithm. We then set the number of  <tt>Steps</tt>, how often we wish the
screen to be updated with information and how often the neighbour list is to be recalculated.

<p> The final line launches the simulation.


<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.8 Running a simple molecular dynamics simulation</h3>

<p> Having run the minimisation we could now try a slightly more complex simulation,
a short molecular dynamics run. As before we create an object md of type <tt>MolecularDynamics</tt>
and set a variety of properties to set up our simulation.

<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## Run some Molecular Dynamics
md = MolecularDynamics(ff)
md.Steps = 2000
md.UpdateScr = 100
md.UpdateTra = 10
md.UpdateNList = 10
md.Integrator = MolecularDynamics.Langevin
md.TargetTemp = Temp(300)
</pre>
</div>

<p> We let the <tt>Integrator</tt> be a langevin simulation (a stochastic simulation), we set the
temperature regime to 300 kelvin. We also set <tt>UpdateTra</tt> to 10, which means that every
10th step we will save a snap shot of the structure into our trajectory that we defined earlier.

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1.9 Monitoring a property during the simulation</h3>

<p> before we actually launch the simulation we will demonstrate another feature of PD, namely the
modular ability to add <tt>Monitors</tt> who's function is to measure properties throughout
a trajectory and save this data for later analysis. This is achieved by creating an object of
type <tt>AtomDistanceMonitor</tt> which takes a target workspace and two atom indices as parameters.
The monitor is added to the simulation using the function <tt>addMonitor</tt> as demonstrated below.
<p><div class="python">
<pre>
# Add a atom-atom distance monitor to the simulation
# (we will monitor atoms with indices 102 and 263)
dist = AtomDistanceMonitor(wspace, 102, 263)
md.addMonitor(dist)

md.run()
</pre>
</div>

<p> After we've added our monitor we launch the simulation by <tt>md.run()</tt>. The algorithm
will now perform 2000 steps of langevin dynamics and the monitor will measure the distance
between atom <tt>102</tt> and <tt>263</tt> after every steps of dynamics.

<h3><a name="t1_a"></a>1.1 Running a simple molecular dynamics simulation</h3>
<p> Now that we've run our trajectory, we would like to see the data gathered. To do this
we use the built-in functions in monitors to write, print and analyse the gathered data.
In this example we will use the function <tt>getHistogram(..)</tt> to turn our raw data
into a histogram with bin width 0.05. The histogram histogram counts are then printed to the screen.
Finally we print the time taken for the program to run (remember we set a timer right a the
beginning).
<p><div class="python">
<pre>
## put the collected data into a histogram with bin width 0.05
dist.getHistogram(0.05).print_count()

## print time taken
timer()
</pre>
</div>


<h2><a name="t1_a"></a>1.2 Running the simulation</h3>

<p> Before you can run the simulation you need the PD python interface file <tt>pd.py</tt>
and the PD library (<tt>_pd.dll</tt> or <tt>_pd.so</tt> in Windows/Unix respecitvely) in the current directory.
You will find these files in the sub directory <tt>/bin</tt> in your distribution directory.

<p> The python script containing this tutorials work is <a href="langevin.py">langevin.py</a>
<p> To launch the simulation you type
<div class="shell"><pre> python langevin.py
</pre></div>


<h2><a name="t1_a"></a>1.3 Conclusion</h3>

We have intentionally chosen a relatively advanced example with the intention to show case the
way PD enables the user to combine it's algorthms in a highly modular fashion using an
intuitive input script. However we have merely touched the surface of the number of possible
properties that can we set or manipulated to create highly customised simulations. In the subsequent
tutorials we will explore other algorithms, techniques and properties devlving deeper and more
fundamentally into the way PD can be used.
