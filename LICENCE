The PD Licence Agreement 02/08/07
University of Bristol
PD: The MMLib and Complementary Python Wrapper
Non-Exclusive, Non-Commercial Use License

Upon execution of this Agreement by the party identified below ("Licensee"), 
The University of Bristol ("Bristol"), on behalf 
of The Computational Biology Group ("CBG") in University of Bristol School of
Medical Sciences, will provide MMLib and its complementary Python Wrapper, 
constituting the molecular dynamics software ("PD") in
Executable Code and/or Source Code form ("Software") to Licensee, subject to
the following terms and conditions. For purposes of this Agreement,
Executable Code is the compiled code, which is ready to run on Licensee's
computer. Source code consists of a set of files which contain the actual
program commands that are compiled to form the Executable Code.

1. The Software is intellectual property owned by Bristol, and all right, 
title and interest, including copyright, remain with Bristol.  Bristol 
grants, and Licensee hereby accepts, a restricted, non-exclusive, 
non-transferable license to use the Software for academic, research and 
internal business purposes only, e.g. not for commercial use (see Clause 7 
below), without a fee. Any modifications, enhancements, additions become the 
property of the PD development team. 

2. Redistribution is not permitted. All software must be hosted on the official
PD webserver.

3. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 
"AS IS" AND BRISTOL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OF 
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES 
OR MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THAT THE USE OF 
THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHTS. 
LICENSEE ASSUMES THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
SOFTWARE AND/OR ASSOCIATED MATERIALS.  LICENSEE AGREES THAT UNIVERSITY SHALL 
NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL 
DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY ON ACCOUNT 
OF OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ASSOCIATED 
MATERIALS.

4. Licensee understands the Software is proprietary to Bristol. Licensee  
agrees to take all reasonable steps to insure that the Software is  
protected and secured from unauthorized disclosure, use, or release and  
will treat it with at least the same level of care as Licensee would use to  
protect and secure its own proprietary computer programs and/or information, 
but using no less than a reasonable standard of care.  Licensee agrees to 
provide the Software only to any other person or entity who has registered 
with Bristol. If licensee is not registering as an individual but as an 
institution or corporation each member of the institution or corporation 
who has access to or uses Software must agree to and abide by the terms 
of this license. If Licensee becomes aware of any unauthorized licensing, 
copying or use of the Software, Licensee shall promptly notify Bristol 
in writing. Licensee expressly agrees to use the Software only in the 
manner and for the specific uses authorized in this Agreement.

5. By using or copying this Software, Licensee agrees to abide by the  
copyright law and all other applicable laws of the U.S. including, but not  
limited to, export control laws and the terms of this license. Bristol  
shall have the right to terminate this license immediately by written  
notice upon Licensee's breach of, or non-compliance with, any
terms of the license. Licensee may be held legally responsible for any  
copyright infringement that is caused or encouraged by its failure to  
abide by the terms of this license. Upon termination, Licensee agrees to  
destroy all copies of the Software in its possession and to verify such  
destruction in writing.

6. The user agrees that any reports or published results obtained with  
the Software will acknowledge its use by the appropriate citation as  
follows:

"PD was developed by the Computational Biology Group at the the University
 of Bristol."

Any published work which utilizes PD shall include the following reference:

"Mike Tyka, Jon Rea, R Sessions. 
 Enhanced Molecular Mechanics Algorithm Development.
 Unpublished, 2003-2007."

Electronic documents will include a direct link to the official PD page  
at https://bch-voodoo.bch.bris.ac.uk/svn/pd/

7. Commercial use of the Software, or derivative works based thereon,  
REQUIRES A COMMERCIAL LICENSE.  Should Licensee wish to make commercial 
use of the Software, Licensee will contact Bristol (m.tyka@bris.ac.uk) to 
negotiate an appropriate license for such use. Commercial use includes: 
(1) integration of all or part of the Software into a product for sale, 
lease or license by or on behalf of Licensee to third parties, or 
(2) distribution of the Software to third parties that need it to 
commercialize product sold or licensed by or on behalf of Licensee.

8. PD is being distributed as a research and teaching tool and as  
such, TCBG encourages contributions from users of the code that might, at  
Bristol' sole discretion, be used or incorporated to make the basic  
operating framework of the Software a more stable, flexible, and/or useful  
product.  Licensees who contribute their code to become an internal  
portion of the Software agree that such code may be distributed by  
Bristol under the terms of this License and may be required to sign an  
"Agreement Regarding Contributory Code for PD Software" before Bristol  
can accept it (contact m.tyka@bris.ac.uk for a copy).

UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED.
