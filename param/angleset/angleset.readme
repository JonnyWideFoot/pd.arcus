Abstract
An Angleset is currently limited to be a protein backbone torsion library i.e. Phi / Psi /Omega.

Name glossary:
All : Parametised Angleset definitions to be used for all protein structure types
Loop: Parametised Angleset definitions for protein loops only
Raft: The original Angleset definition used in the RAFT application and paper

Defaults
It is recommended that the end user use default.xxx.angleset where ‘xxx’ is the desired structure set. 
These should be suitable for most purposed.

Viewer
The viewer is a little program to look at the contents of an anglset library. It is written using C# 
and the .Net framework, and uses functionality provided by the UoBFramwork.

All and Loop Folders
These folders contain anglesets for every sensible permutation of the fitted torsion parameters. 
The file naming format is:
a_b_c.xxx.angleset
Where:
a = The number of angles for each residue type
b = The number of angles for Proline
c = The number of angles for Glycine
xxx = The parametised structure type, being either loop or all.

Method
The angles were chosen by a per-residue monte carlo search on an idealised PDB database. The scoring 
function was a RMSD minimisation of the distance of each angle from the database to its nearest fitted 
angle. The original raft work was based upon a 2 degree grid search over the Ramachandran space. The 
more recent work was performed in late 2004, and uses a much larger data set that the original RAFT work 
performed in ~1995.
