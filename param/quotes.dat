A hot-air balloonist had drifted off course. He saw a man on the ground and shouted, "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?" "Yes," the guy said, "you're in a balloon." "you must work in IT," the balloonist said. "How did you know?" asked the man on the ground. " What you told me is technically correct, but of no use to anyone."
